>
> Welcome to the Department of Medical Oncology at the Townsville Cancer
> Centre. By the end of the term, you should be able to identify and
> manage common side effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the
> areas of general practice, emergency departments and rural hospitals
> and general medical wards. You will also have some understanding of
> treatment principles and aims of cancer therapy for common
> malignancies. This handbook is meant for the use of resident medical
> officers and basic physician trainees. It may also be useful to
> advanced trainees in their first few months of training. We hope that
> this experience will give you the skills to deal with cancer patients
> with positive and empathetic approach.
>
> If you are encountering emotional difficulties when dealing with poor
> prognosis, please talk to one of us earlier in the term to learn ways
> to deal with it effectively.
>
> Enjoy the medical oncology rotation.

> **<u>ORIENTATION TO MEDICAL ONCOLOGY DEPARTMENT</u>**
>
> Junior medical officers play an important role in the day-to-day care
> of patients in Medical Oncology Department. It is critical that you
> work in close collaboration with senior medical, nursing and allied
> health staff, along with our administrative support officers.
>
> We have outlined some useful practice points will help you to settle
> into our department smoothly.
>
> ***Educational*** ***and*** ***training*** ***resources***
>
> *Electronic* *medical* *records*
>
> Townsville Cancer Centre uses MOSAIQ as its EMR. Please become
> familiar with MOSAIQ by contacting the CNC for MOSAIQ on 32888 or
> through our administrative support officers 44331671 prior to
> commencement. We assume that you are familiar with the ieMR, the
> THHS-wide EMR.
>
> *Chemotherapy* *protocol*
>
> eviQ is a very useful website to learn chemotherapy protocols and
> side-effects. It also contains information about managing
> extravasation [<u>(www.eviq.org.au</u>)](http://www.eviq.org.au/).
>
> **NB:** **RMOs** **and** **interns** **are** **not** **expected**
> **to** **write** **chemotherapy** **orders.** **When** **writing**
> **oral** **chemotherapy,** **targeted** **agents** **and** **colony**
> **stimulating** **factors,** **please** **exercise** **caution**
> **and** **follow** **the** **advice** **of** **your** **registrars**
> **and** **consultants.**
>
> *Medication* *prescribing*
>
> Quality of inpatient medication prescribing can be improved by
> adhering to the THHS guide for inpatient medication prescription.
>
> *End* *of* *life* *care* *bedside* *tutorial* *and* *introduction*

>
> These two topics are available on YouTube (searchable using the
> titles) and are useful resources for developing mental frameworks for
> approaching these topics.
>
> *Basic* *principles* *of* *oncology*
>

>
> ***Documentation***
>
> Since funding for operations of medical departments are linked to
> their clinical activities, it is important to use coding terminologies
> during documentation of patient notes.
>
> ***Issues*** ***with*** ***central*** ***venous*** ***access***
> ***devices***
>
> We use central lines commonly in oncology and therefore, it is prudent
> to be aware of managing complications. As a rule, when it is difficult
> to draw blood from lines or inject fluids, it is important to use
> imaging (including chest-Xray and linogram) for checking the position
> and viability before using the lines. Please seek advice when
> infection and thrombosis are suspected/proven. We can rarely save
> lines using antibiotics
>
> ***Self-care***
>
> Please maintain physical, emotional, mental and spiritual health. Take
> regular breaks as much as possible and maintain effective work-life
> balance (This doesn’t mean work is bad and life is good; it is about
> having a balance that suits your needs). Please seek help if you think
> you need help including emotional support and guidance.
>
> ***Day*** ***unit***
>
> • Orientate with the Day-unit staff and introduce yourself to senior
> nursing staff and establish working relationships with them.
>
> • You are the first point of call for any issues in day unit and
> therefore, please make sure that you are always available during
> rostered hours. Day unit relies on effective discharge of patients to
> maintain flow. A delay due to one issue could delay the whole day’s
> operation and care of other patients.
>
> • Infusion reactions are medical emergencies: You should always attend
> to a patient having a reaction, leaving everything else. If you are
> not available, please make sure another doctor can attend the patient
> immediately.
>
> ***Clinics***
>
> • Being “On Time” is important! Clinics start on time so that patients
> can receive their chemotherapy in day unit without delays.
>
> • If a patient is seen by the consultant in clinic, please ask them to
> sign the blue form.
>
> ***Dealing*** ***with*** ***consultants*** ***and*** ***registrars***
>
> Please don’t hesitate to seek help from senior medical staff. All
> changes in management should be discussed. Harass them even if they
> are busy!
>
> 4
>
> ***Dealing*** ***with*** ***nurses*** ***and*** ***other***
> ***health*** ***professionals***
>
> • Advice from nursing staff is an important resource for patient care.
>
> • When chemotherapy changes, delays or cancellation occur, it is
> prudent to inform the nursing and pharmacy staff.
>
> ***Dealing*** ***with*** ***patients*** ***on*** ***chemotherapy***
> ***and*** ***chemotherapy*** ***orders***
>
> • When you see a patient for chemotherapy review, please prepare the
> care plans for the next cycle.
>
> • Dose reduction: After consultation with senior medical staff, please
> document dose reductions and make changes on MOSAIQ scripts. If there
> is a dose increase, it is possible only from the next cycle.
>
> • All chemotherapy bookings are done through administration officers
> and day unit schedulers.
>
> • Initial chemotherapy orders should be counter-signed by a
> consultant.
>
> • Please be familiar with important practice points for common
> medications as described in this hand book.
>
> ***Admitted*** ***patients***
>
> • Make sure they are seen by consultants within 24 hours of admission
> and on a regular basis;
>
> • Have an expected date of discharge and do the discharge planning,
> including timely completion of high-quality discharge summaries;
> **ideally** **on** **the** **day** **of** **discharge,** **using**
> **the** **national** **guide** **for** **discharge** **summaries**.
>
> • If a patient undergoing chemotherapy is admitted with complications,
> inform the day-unit and the treating consultant of any changes in
> treatment. It will also be important to document this episode on
> MOSAIQ for continuity of care and future planning including dose
> changes and addition of GCSF.
>
> • If any oncology patient is admitted in another department or another
> hospital with complications, inform the treating consultant and
> document on MOSAIQ.
>
> • In-patient consults from other departments need to be seen on the
> same day, discussed with or seen by the consultant on call and
> documented on MOSAIQ.
>
> • It is important to inform the consultant on call of any patients
> admitted to medical oncology.

>
> **<u>PRINCIPLES OF MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS ON</u>** **<u>SYSTEMIC
> THERAPY</u>**
>
> ***Assessing*** ***fitness*** ***for*** ***systemic*** ***therapy***
>
> Fitness for systemic therapy depends on many factors:
>
> • performance status,
>
> • the type and severity of side effects from previous cycles or doses,
> • blood parameters,
>
> • co-morbidities and • Patient choice
>
> If cure is the aim, it is usual to accept mild-to-moderate,
> non-life-threatening toxicities and continue treatment without
> delaying or reducing the dosage to minimise side effects. Sometimes it
> is prudent to use supportive therapy such as G-CSF to maintain dose
> intensity. However, in patients with incurable metastatic disease
> where quality of life is paramount, dose delays or dose reductions are
> necessary.
>
> ***Performance*** ***status***
>
> This is graded using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
> scale.
>
> **Grade** **ECOG** **performance** **status**
>
> 0 Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without
> restriction.
>
> 1 Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able
> to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, e.g., light house
> work, office work
>
> 2 Ambulatory and capable of all selfcare but unable to carry out any
> work activities. Up and about more than 50% of waking hours
>
> 3 Capable of only limited selfcare, confined to bed or chair more than
> 50% of waking hours
>
> 4 Completely disabled, cannot carry on any self-care, totally confined
> to bed or chair
>
> Usually, patients with ECOG grade \> 2 are not fit for chemotherapy.
> The exception is chemotherapy-sensitive cancers such as lymphoma and
> small cell lung cancers. The decision to offer chemotherapy must be
> individualised, depending upon factors such as age of the patient, &
> comorbidities. For example, a young patient with metastatic breast
>
> 9
>
> cancer with poor performance status could still be offered systemic
> treatments. Targeted agents and endocrine therapy are usually
> tolerated better than chemotherapy.
>
> ***Toxicity*** ***from*** ***previous*** ***cycles*** ***of***
> ***systemic*** ***therapy***
>
> Clinicians must assess whether a side effect is affecting QOL,
> performance status or is life threatening:
>
> First, determine the type and severity of side effects.
>
> For example, in patients with early breast cancers undergoing taxane
> chemotherapy, mild peripheral neuropathy is acceptable. However, in
> patients undergoing fluorouracil-based therapy, ongoing or severe
> diarrhoea necessitates a dose delay and dose reduction of subsequent
> cycles.
>
> Mid-cycle neutropenic fever usually requires dose reduction of the
> subsequent cycle unless the cancer is curable. If the cancer is
> curable or a substantial duration of remission is expected,
> prophylactic colony stimulating factors such as pegfilgrastim
> (neulasta) and/or antibiotics can reduce the risk of subsequent and
> opportunistic infections.
>
> Next, determine the effects on important organs, such as:
>
> • Fertility. Discuss semen cryopreservation with men. Options for
> women should also be discussed, particularly in young women of
> child-bearing potential and where curative intention treatment is
> planned. Options include preservation of egg, embryo and a piece of
> ovary is offered by some fertility groups. Women who wish to discuss
> this option should be referred to a fertility specialist.
>
> • Renal function, liver functions.
>
> • Cardiac function. This may affect the dosage of anthracyclines
> (check ejection fraction before treatment begins and after every 2–3
> cycles) and trastuzumab (check ejection fraction before treatment
> begins and every 3 months during therapy).
>
> Toxicity is graded according to NCI common terminology criteria for
> adverse events**1**. 1. Blood parameters:
>
> a\. Requires haematological and non-haematological parameters.
>
> **1** National cancer institute common toxicity criteria *(CTCAE,*

>
> For most regimens, a neutrophil count \>1.5 x 109/L and platelet count
> \> 100 x 109/L are needed for safe administration of chemotherapy. For
> some regimens, lower levels may be acceptable.
>
> Single agent bleomycin and vincristine are not myelotoxic and
> administration is not affected by blood counts.
>
> Renal function is important for cisplatin and carboplatin and liver

>
> h\. Pulmonary toxicity- bleomycin, methotrexate.
>
> 3\. Physical examination-Routine exam and oral cavity, central lines
> and IV site infections, lymph nodes and signs of recurrence and side
> effects.
>
> 11
>
> **Symptom** **control**
>
> Discussion or shared care with palliative care is helpful. However,
> basic principles are as follows:
>
> (Also refer to the Guide for inpatient medication prescription)
>
> 1\. Pain: Always find out the cause of the pain before prescribing
> analgesics.
>
> Total daily morphine requirement will guide the required daily slow
> release dose. When prescribing breakthrough, the dose is 1/6th of the
> daily dose. So, if you are increasing the daily dose, breakthrough
> needs to increase as well. If oral intake is difficult—patches or
> infusional morphine are options.
>
> 4\. Dyspnoea: Again, find out the cause, for cancer related
> dyspnoea—nebulised morphine and anxiolytics could be helpful.
>
> **When** **to** **stop** **cancer** **treatment**
>
> A decision to stop treatment prematurely depends on the aim of the
> treatment.
>
> For curable cancers, it is acceptable to continue treatment with dose
> modifications. However, life threatening or severe dose limiting
> toxicities usually necessitate cessation of treatment (eg. moderate to
> severe peripheral neuropathy with taxanes and oxaliplatin, severe
> enteritis from fluorouracil). Alternative regimens are sometimes
> available.
>
> If the cancer is incurable and the toxicities severely interfere with
> the activities of daily living, treatment may have to be stopped.
>
> Deteriorating performance status and organ function usually require
> cessation of treatment. Ongoing neutropenia or thrombocytopenia
> typically means the patient is not going to handle further
> chemotherapy.
>
> In case of patients with metastatic disease, palliative care team
> referral is done even when they are on active treatment, to improve
> symptom management and supportive care.

> **<u>PRINCIPLES OF CANCER IMMUNOTHERAPY</u>**
>
> (CTLA4 outcompetes CD28 for CD80 and CD86, and the costimulatory
> signal ceases as the target is eliminated, reducing the release of
> pro-effector cytokines such as IL-12 and cytotoxic enzymes such as
> perforin and granzyme B. Homeostasis is restored.)
>
> In a state of chronic antigen presentation, such as malignancy, the
> chronic presence of antigen or pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-12, IFN
> gamma, etc) can upregulate PD-1 expression on the T cell; tumour
> clones can also select for PD-L1 expression. With PD-1-PD-L1 binding,
> even in the presence of the costimulatory molecule, "peripheral
> exhaustion" can occur.
>
> The anti-CTLA-4 antibody,
> [<u>ipilimumab</u>](http://www.uptodate.com.tsproxy.slq.qld.gov.au/contents/ipilimumab-drug-information?source=see_link)
> was the first immune checkpoint inhibitor to be approved based upon
> its ability to prolong survival in patients with metastatic melanoma.
>
> Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) is a trans-membrane protein expressed
> on T cells, B cells, and NK cells. It is an inhibitory molecule that
> binds to PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1; also known as B7-H1) and PD-L2 (B7-H2).
> PD-L1 is expressed on the surface of multiple tissue types, including
> many tumour cells, as well as hematopoietic cells; The IgG4 subclass
> PD-1 inhibiting antibodies like

>
> **Immune** **Response** **Criteria**: The patterns of response to
> treatment with these immunotherapy agents differ from those with
> molecularly-targeted agents or cytotoxic chemotherapy in several
> important respects.
>
> ***Toxicities*** ***associated*** ***with*** ***checkpoint***
> ***inhibitor*** ***immunotherapy***
>
> Checkpoint inhibition is associated with a unique spectrum of side
> effects termed immune-related adverse events (irAEs) or, occasionally,
> adverse events of special
>
> interest. IrAEs include dermatologic, gastrointestinal, hepatic,
> endocrine, and other less common inflammatory events**4**.
>
> In general, treatment of moderate or severe irAEs requires
> interruption of the checkpoint inhibitor and the use of corticosteroid
> immunosuppression. Treatment is based upon the severity of the
> observed toxicity:
>
> • For patients with grade 2 (moderate) immune-mediated toxicities,
> treatment with the checkpoint inhibitor should be withheld and should
> not be resumed until symptoms or toxicity is grade 1 or less.
> Corticosteroids should be started if symptoms do not resolve quickly.
>
> • For patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 (severe or life-threatening)
> immune-mediated toxicities, treatment with the checkpoint inhibitor
> should be permanently discontinued. High doses of corticosteroids
> [(<u>prednisone</u>](http://www.uptodate.com.tsproxy.slq.qld.gov.au/contents/prednisone-drug-information?source=see_link)
> 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or equivalent) should be given. When symptoms subside
> to grade 1 or less, steroids can be gradually tapered over at least
> one month.
>
> • Patients who will benefit from corticosteroids generally do so
> within days. If symptoms do not clearly improve, particularly after
> approximately three days with intravenous steroids, our approach is to
> administer
> [<u>infliximab</u>](http://www.uptodate.com.tsproxy.slq.qld.gov.au/contents/infliximab-drug-information?source=see_link)
> (5 mg/kg) rather than continue with a prolonged course of high-dose IV
> corticosteroids. If symptoms persist after the first infliximab dose,
> a second dose of infliximab (5 mg/kg) can be repeated two weeks after
